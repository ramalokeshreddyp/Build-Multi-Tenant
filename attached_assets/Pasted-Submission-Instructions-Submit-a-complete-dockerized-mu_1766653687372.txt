Submission Instructions
Submit a complete, dockerized multi-tenant SaaS application with full documentation.

Required Submissions:

GitHub Repository (Public)

All source code for backend API and frontend application
Database migration files and seed data
Complete project structure with proper organization
Minimum 30 commits with meaningful commit messages
Repository must be public and accessible
Dockerized Application (MANDATORY)

Docker Compose Configuration: A complete docker-compose.yml file in the project root that defines ALL THREE services (database, backend API, and frontend)
Frontend Containerization (MANDATORY): Frontend MUST be containerized. All three services (database, backend, frontend) MUST start with a single command: docker-compose up -d
Fixed Port Mappings (MANDATORY):
Database: Port 5432 (external) → 5432 (internal)
Backend: Port 5000 (external) → 5000 (internal)
Frontend: Port 3000 (external) → 3000 (internal)
Service Names (MANDATORY):
Database service MUST be named: database
Backend service MUST be named: backend
Frontend service MUST be named: frontend
Backend Dockerfile: A properly configured Dockerfile for the backend application with optimized multi-stage builds
Frontend Dockerfile: A properly configured Dockerfile for the frontend application
Service Configuration: All services must be properly configured with environment variables, dependencies, and networking
Environment Variables: All environment variables MUST be present in the repository (either in .env file committed to repo, or directly in docker-compose.yml). Evaluation script needs access to all environment variables.
Volume Management: Database data persistence using Docker volumes
Database Initialization (MANDATORY - Automatic Only): Database migrations MUST run automatically when backend service starts
Seed Data Loading (MANDATORY - Automatic Only): Seed data MUST load automatically after migrations complete
No manual commands allowed - everything must be automatic via Dockerfile entrypoint or startup script
Seed Data Requirements: You can choose your own seed data, but MUST include minimum:
At least one super_admin user
At least one tenant with tenant_admin
At least one regular user per tenant
At least one project per tenant
At least one task per project
ALL seed data credentials MUST be documented in submission.json under testCredentials section
Documentation: Clear instructions in README.md on how to run the application using docker-compose up -d
Testing: The application must be fully functional when started with Docker Compose (all services start successfully, database migrations run, seed data loads, health check endpoint responds, frontend is accessible)
Why Docker is Required: Dockerization ensures consistent environments, easy evaluation, dependency management, and reproducibility. Without Docker, the application cannot be evaluated.
Documentation Artifacts

README.md: Complete project documentation with setup instructions (including Docker setup), architecture overview, and API documentation links
docs/research.md: Multi-tenancy analysis, technology stack justification, security considerations (minimum 1700 words total)
docs/PRD.md: Product Requirements Document with user personas, 15+ functional requirements, 5+ non-functional requirements
docs/architecture.md: System architecture diagram, database ERD, complete API endpoint list
docs/technical-spec.md: Project structure and development setup guide (must include Docker setup instructions)
docs/API.md or Swagger/Postman: Complete API documentation for all 19 endpoints
docs/images/system-architecture.png: High-level system architecture diagram
docs/images/database-erd.png: Entity Relationship Diagram showing all tables and relationships
Submission JSON File (MANDATORY)

File: submission.json in repository root
Purpose: Contains test credentials for automated evaluation
MUST include: ALL seed data credentials (super admin, tenant admins, users, etc.)
Format: See detailed format specification in task documentation
Note: Documentation, demo video, and tech stack are collected separately in the submission form
Demo Video (YouTube)

Upload to YouTube as Unlisted or Public
Duration: 5-12 minutes
Must include: Introduction, architecture walkthrough, running application demo (tenant registration, user management, project & task management, multi-tenancy demonstration), code walkthrough
Include YouTube link in README.md
Submit YouTube link separately in submission form (not in submission.json)
Evaluation Focus:

Complete data isolation between tenants
Proper authentication and authorization implementation
All 19 API endpoints functional and properly secured
Frontend pages with role-based access control
Docker configuration and containerization (MANDATORY)
Database initialization and seed data loading
Health check endpoint functionality
Comprehensive documentation quality
Evaluation Overview
Your submission will be evaluated through multiple dimensions to assess both functional completeness and code quality.

Functional Evaluation: We will test all 19 API endpoints to verify they work correctly, return proper status codes, and enforce authentication and authorization. We will verify data isolation by attempting cross-tenant access scenarios. The frontend will be tested for all required pages, role-based UI visibility, and responsive design. We will verify Docker setup by running docker-compose up -d and testing the health check endpoint.

Docker Configuration Evaluation: We will verify that your application is properly dockerized with a working docker-compose.yml file and Dockerfile(s) for all three services (database, backend, frontend). We will test that all services start successfully using docker-compose up -d with fixed port mappings (database: 5432, backend: 5000, frontend: 3000), that database migrations run correctly (automatically or via documented command), that seed data loads properly (automatically or via documented command), and that the application is fully functional in the containerized environment. Docker configuration is mandatory for evaluation.

Database Initialization Evaluation: We will verify that the database is properly initialized with migrations and seed data. We will read test credentials from your submission.json file and check that the documented seed data exists in the database after initialization. We will test login with credentials from your submission.json to verify seed data is correctly loaded.

Code Quality Review: Your codebase will be analyzed for organization, security best practices, error handling, and architectural patterns. We will review database schema design, query optimization, and proper use of transactions. Authentication and authorization implementation will be examined for security vulnerabilities. Docker configuration quality and best practices will also be assessed.

Documentation Assessment: All documentation artifacts will be reviewed for completeness, clarity, and technical depth. Research documents will be evaluated for analysis quality and justification of design decisions. Architecture diagrams will be assessed for clarity and completeness. API documentation will be checked for accuracy and comprehensiveness. Docker setup instructions in README.md will be verified for clarity and completeness.

Human Review: Visual aspects including UI/UX quality, responsive design, and user experience will be evaluated. Your demo video will be reviewed for presentation quality and feature demonstration. Architecture diagrams and documentation will be assessed for clarity and professional presentation. Docker configuration and containerization approach will be evaluated for quality and best practices.

Security & Best Practices: We will verify proper password hashing, JWT security, input validation, SQL injection prevention, and proper error handling. Audit logging implementation and data isolation mechanisms will be thoroughly examined. Docker security best practices (non-root users, minimal base images, proper secret management) will also be assessed.
